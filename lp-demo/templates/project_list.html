      <p>This was a goof to teach myself about javascript and html5's canvas. I've still got a lot of learning there but I'm happy with this first attempt. There isn't anything too fancy about this version, just gets something up and running.</p>

      <p>I made this for my dad. He restores old radios and needs to replace the dials that appear on the radio. This makes it easy to create images of dial markers to play with. This first version is written in processing but I plan to redo it with javascript and canvas. He has a nice list of features to add to this. :-)</p>
